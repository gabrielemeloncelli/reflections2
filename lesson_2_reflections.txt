What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates the hidden folder and the files it uses for version control.
With this activity you are telling git that you will need version control for the files and subfolders contintained in the main folder.
And manage them as as related, a single project or whatever is the definition in git parlance.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area groups files ready to be committed to the repository.
The working directory simply contains files one needs for the job, including temporary files and working drafts.
The staging area can group files that are logically connected, so that they are added to the repository in a single commit.
