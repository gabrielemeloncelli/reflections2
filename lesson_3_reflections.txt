When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
There are many reasons to use a remote repository:
- when you use different computers to work on a project
- when you collaborate with other people on the same project
- when you want to have a central repository in case your computer will not be available (you cannot bring it with you, it is under repair, etc.)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- forks are copies of a cloud project to another cloud project
- clones are loca copy of a remote or a local project
- branches are separate modification threads of the same project

Forks are used mainly to modify some open project and adapt to one's need without being part of the main project development team.
Clones are used mainly for collaborative development. All the developers clone the cloud project and push the modifications back when done.
Branches are used for implementing new features, refactor code, implement experimental modifications, etc. 
They can be merged to the main branch if the result is good.
