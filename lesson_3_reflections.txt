When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
There are many reasons to use a remote repository:
- when you use different computers to work on a project
- when you collaborate with other people on the same project
- when you want to have a central repository in case your computer will not be available (you cannot bring it with you, it is under repair, etc.)
